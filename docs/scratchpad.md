# namesearch.io Project Scratchpad

## Ongoing Notes
[2024-03-21] Current Status: Setting up core search interface
- Installing and configuring shadcn/ui components
- Setting up project infrastructure
- Implementing advanced search form
- Current blocker: Module resolution issues with shadcn/ui components

[2024-03-21] Shifted focus to technical frontend implementation
- Created new implementation plan for power-user focused interface
- Prioritizing advanced search features and domain analysis tools
- Emphasis on keyboard-first navigation and efficient workflows
- Planning to implement core search interface first

[2024-03-21] Previous note: Shifted focus from brochure website to technical domain search platform
- Created new implementation plan focusing on API-first development
- Core features now include advanced domain search, WHOIS integration, and cultural analysis
- Emphasis on performance, scalability, and technical capabilities
- Planning to implement proper API infrastructure before frontend development

## Blockers
- Module resolution issues with shadcn/ui components
  - Components are present but not being resolved correctly
  - Need to verify component installation and path aliases
  - May need to reinstall components or fix path configuration

Previous blockers:
- Need to identify and select appropriate WHOIS API provider
- Need to determine NLP model requirements for cultural analysis
- Need to establish Redis and PostgreSQL infrastructure

## Lessons Learned
[2024-03-21] Component Installation
- Lesson: Need to verify component installation and path resolution before implementation
- Action: Checking project structure and configuration files
- Impact: Will ensure proper component integration

[2024-03-21] Frontend needs to be power-user focused
- Lesson: Should design for domain professionals and power users first
- Action: Created new implementation plan with keyboard-first navigation and advanced features
- Impact: Will lead to more efficient and professional user experience

[2024-03-21] Initial approach was too focused on marketing/brochure style website
- Lesson: Should have started with technical requirements and API design
- Action: Created new implementation plan with API-first approach
- Impact: Will lead to more scalable and maintainable platform
