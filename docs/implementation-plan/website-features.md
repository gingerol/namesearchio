# Website Features Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
NameSearch.io is a culturally-intelligent domain search platform that helps businesses find globally appropriate domain names. This implementation plan focuses on building the core website features, including multilingual search, cultural intelligence analysis, domain suggestions, and real-time availability checking.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Multilingual Support**
   - Challenge: Supporting multiple languages for search and UI
   - Solution: Implement next-intl for internationalization
   - Risk: Translation accuracy and performance

2. **Cultural Intelligence**
   - Challenge: Accurate cultural analysis of domain names
   - Solution: Fine-tuned BERT models with spaCy
   - Risk: Model accuracy and processing time

3. **Real-time Domain Availability**
   - Challenge: Fast and accurate domain availability checks
   - Solution: Redis caching + custom search implementation
   - Risk: API rate limits and response times

4. **Performance and Scalability**
   - Challenge: Handling multiple concurrent searches
   - Solution: Edge caching, optimistic UI updates
   - Risk: Server load and response times
