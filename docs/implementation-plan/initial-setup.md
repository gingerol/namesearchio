# Initial Project Setup Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
The NameSearch.io project requires a solid foundation before development can begin. This implementation plan focuses on setting up the development environment, establishing the project structure, and implementing core infrastructure components. This setup is crucial as it will support all future development work and ensure consistency across the team.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Remote Development Environment**
   - Need to ensure all developers can work effectively on the remote server
   - Must establish secure access and proper environment isolation
   - Need to set up proper development tools and configurations

2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Database (PostgreSQL) and caching (Redis) services need to be properly configured
   - Environment variables and secrets management
   - Development, staging, and production environment separation

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Git workflow and branching strategy
   - Code quality tools and CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Testing infrastructure

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
*To be filled by the Executor during implementation*

## Branch Name
`setup/initial-environment`

## Dependencies
- Remote server access
- Administrative privileges for initial setup
- Team member SSH public keys

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Server Access Issues**
   - Risk: Delays in setting up developer access
   - Mitigation: Prepare access documentation in advance

2. **Database Migration**
   - Risk: Data loss during setup
   - Mitigation: Regular backups and careful migration planning

3. **Environment Conflicts**
   - Risk: Development environment affecting production
   - Mitigation: Proper isolation and environment separation

## Lessons Learned
*To be filled during implementation*

## Notes
- Each phase should be completed and verified before moving to the next
- All documentation should be updated as we progress
- Regular backups should be maintained throughout the setup process
