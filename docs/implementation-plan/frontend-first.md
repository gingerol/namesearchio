# Frontend-First Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
Building the frontend first to validate all functionalities and user flows before backend implementation. This includes both admin and user dashboards with hot reload for immediate feedback.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Challenge: Creating a maintainable frontend structure
   - Solution: Clear component hierarchy and state management
   - Risk: Component reusability

2. **User Experience**
   - Challenge: Intuitive interfaces for both admin and users
   - Solution: Rapid prototyping with hot reload
   - Risk: UX consistency
